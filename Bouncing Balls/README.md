# Bouncuing Balls

A canvas drawing with 5 balls that bounce off inside a circlar container. Balls get bigger each time they collide and get a color assigned from a color palette.

Next steps:
* Make sure balls do not exceed the container boundry
* Make balls fill all aavailable space at the end
* Make ball diameter increases smaller as balls become larger
* Prevent the very quick oscillations towards the end o fthe animation when balls fill the container
* Add a restart button so the animation can be restarted easily without needing a page refresh
* Expose config variables like number of balls, max speed, etc on the UI so users can experiment with changing them
